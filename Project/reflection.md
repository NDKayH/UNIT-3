### Q1. What was the most proud moment for you during this project?

My most proud moment was probably when I was able to get my app to run with extremely minimal bugs or errors. It felt good to have my database being updated in real time, and my functions work as intended. 

### Q1. + 2 What worked well this time?

I think my technical know-how worked well on this project. I felt pretty confident in the skills I learned during class time especially over the course of the past couple months. I think I came into the coding-aspect of the project actually confident and ready to write out my Kivy file and my Classes for each screen using OOP. 

### Q3. What will you do differently for Unit 4 / IA

I would do my documentation differently. After the following class after submissions and once I received my feedback, I felt like I was missing the bigger picture with these projects: It is essentially an IA, and follows a very similar if not the same rubric, and with this in mind I should try as much as possible to stick to the rubric starting as early on in my project process as possible to ensure I leave nothing missing when I submit my project. 

### Q4. What do you need help with? 

I think something I need help with is with documentation, and getting feedback before submission. However, I do recognize that it is also in part my responsibility to perhaps ask for feedback ahead of the project deadline.
