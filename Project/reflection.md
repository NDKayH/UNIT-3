### Q1. What was the most proud moment for you during this project?

My most proud moment was probably when I was able to get my app to run with extremely minimal bugs or errors. It felt great to see my database updating in real time, and my functions working exactly as intended.

### Q1. + 2 What worked well this time?

I believe my technical know-how was a key factor in this project. I felt confident using the skills I acquired in class, especially over the past couple of months. I approached the coding aspect of the project with a readiness to write my Kivy file and create Classes for each screen using an OOP approach, which proved to be very effective.

### Q3. What will you do differently for Unit 4 / IA?

For Unit 4/IA, I plan to focus more on documentation. After submitting this project and receiving feedback, I realized I was missing the bigger picture. Since the IA follows a very similar rubric, I will ensure that I align my documentation process with the rubric requirements from the very beginning of the project. This will help me avoid missing any critical elements during submission.

### Q4. What do you need help with?

I would appreciate help with documentation and receiving feedback before the final submission. I also recognize that itâ€™s my responsibility to seek feedback ahead of project deadlines, and I plan to be more proactive in that regard.
